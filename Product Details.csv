5,A Good One from your home. Go for it. ,"First things first, I have purchased OP Y 43-inches smart TV @ 24K- it's a great deal for me. Apart from it, this TV is one of the best smart TV's out there in the market that you can get. The User Interface is clean and doesn't lags while operating the tv. Also, the picture quality is up to my expectations. The after-sales is also great. I got my TV installed by a guy named Sonu from Jeeves. He was highly professional and explained all the features of the TV."
5,Wonderful,"Delighted view, and Great Experience. Only point which applies to all Smart TV is that they need wifi Network close to Device, they dont work so good with Signals coming through walls. But this problemIs with all companies"
1,Utterly Disappointed,"low picture quality, you can not get picture quality like sony in this oneplus dabba tv. i bought it thinking the name oneplus in mind, but it is just like dabba tv. not feeling like watching LED tv...."

5,Terrific purchase,OnePlus Smart Android TV 43 inch is the best budget smart TV from a premium brand like OnePlus. The video panel used in this TV is mind blowing. It is even better than some other 4K panels. The colour is rich and clear. The build quality of the TV is also very good. This TV is truely bezelless and looks very very premium. Android TV UI is very smooth and responsive. It also has Bluetooth and wifi connectivity which is very useful feature. I am very satisfied with the over all performance of t...
5,Perfect product!,Value for moneyI used Last one monthPicture Quality was Awesome and no issues in connectivity because of OnePlus Connect App.Sound Quality was decent for that price range.1GB RAM & 8 GB internal memory it's not enough for heavy users like gaming.Overall Nice Product from OnePlus
5,Great product,Thank you Flipkart for delivering tv in this situation just within 2 days and one thing that surprised me was installation within 4 hours. I was extremely mind blown with the service in got. I had uninstalled flipkart as I was not happy with it 4 years ago but reinstalling and trying it again was worth it.Another Great news is NO cost EMI upto 9 months from Flipkart on purchase of TV. This is just Wowww!!! Thanks to the delivery agent and installation guy who did thier job flawlessly.
5,Classy product,OnePlus Smart Android TV 43 inch is the best value for money LED TV available in this price segment. After doing a lot of research I finally decided to purchase this TV for my home. After using this TV for few days now I have to say that I am very impressed with the over all build quality of this TV. This TV looks very premium and the display is just gorgeous. It also has bluetooth and wifi connectivity. The remote comes with google assistant built in which is very useful feature. The sound o...
5,Best in the market!,"It's a good android TV, doesn't support all the apps in the play store, If you need to plug an USB make sure USB is in NTFS.Sound is good for a small room, There is a connectivity issue, while connecting to phone."
4,Delightful,Its a 32 inch one plus TV .Coming picture quality Dth which is a standard connection looks very normal colours are pretty messed up no sharpness.other you tube and Netflix looks OK in hd but still not sharp enuf other than that sound is good .Connectivity is of no issues  using it for 7 days so far good no problem.May be after 3 months i will once again come up with another review.
5,Awesome,I love this TV because of it's loud but also sustainable audio quality and good picture quality.Also it has a very good ui along with a shortcut key on the remote.
5,Simply awesome,Nice tv with a great picture quality and good sound system Have a feel of a premium tv with baseless design Overall a perfect tv in this range Looking for a tv with good picture quality sound system and value for money .... For sure go for it ‚ö°
5,Fabulous!,TV is beautiful with minute bezels.I was pleased by the picture quality in firstI expected a smooth software from oneplus but TV operation is bit slow probably due to 1gb ram and lower clocked processor. Can't complaint at this price point. Wish oneplus would release better optimized software in update. Software update was one of my reason to buy TV from oneplus.Response from the bluetooth remote was bit slow.
4,Nice product,Overall performance is top notch especially i can feel the Dolby Atmos which makes a best impression towards this product though I've came across some slowness in the oxygen OS of this one plus y series waiting for an software update to fix this issue and also it'd be great if the tv supports 4k but it's reasonable for this budget segment ..... Hope you found this has useful !!!!!!
3,Does the job,One plus is undoubtedly a good brand to choose..sound was very good...but d picture quality axpected lill more clear...if ur setup box is having hd connection then its amazing but in normal mode it was not satisfactory.... settings options must be user friendly
5,Terrific purchase,It's simply great tv in its price segmentsLoved the youtube/Netflix 1080p videosBut setup box quality was not that good which may be setup box issueBut it's completely different than other brands such as mi/realme/sony/lgRemote is clicky and smooth as butter‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Wonderful,OnePlus has recently launched their Android LED TV in India and according to customer reviews it is providing best value for money smart LED TV at very reasonable prices. I finally after a lot of research purchased this 40 inch OnePlus TV and I am very happy with the over all build quality and performance of this TV. It looks very premium and elegant. The piano black colour looks very good. The video quality is superb.
5,Wonderful,"My personal experience is just that : I feel stunning picture quality & sound quality is awesome, it is best in terms of Smart TV which we all needed. Some fools expect that the TV sound should act like Woofer, so for them kindly go to enjoy the sound & huge screen with VFX in the multiplex. Running smooth with no lagging.Commonly people know the ONEPLUS & it is such a decent brand.GO FOR IT üëç"

It just keeps hanging.Overall... its frustrating experience. Go for TCL instead of One+

1,Very poor,Generally 1plus is a good brand but even at a price of 16k OnePlus cannot afford to give such third grade products. Probably they should take this product off from circulation. Such pathetic was the quality of this particular product. Am not sure about how is the performance of higher end products in OnePlus but this definitely is not something to consider at all.

1,Poor product and no return,Very poor display. It gives eye strains and headaches.The colours looks faded and the sharpness is too high.It is pinching to the eyes.never expected such a poor product from 1+Moreover the flipkart refuses to return it.Be extremely cautious before buying.I will not recommend it at all.I feel like being cheated.
